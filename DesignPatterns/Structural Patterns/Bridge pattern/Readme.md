# Bridge pattern
```
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class 
or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction
and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance 
to separate responsibilities into different classes.

## When to use:
```
this pattern is very useful when designing systems where multiple different 
kinds of inheritance are possible; Bridge allows you to implement these 
inheritances without tightly binding to their abstractions.
```
