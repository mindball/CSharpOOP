# Composite Pattern
![UML](https://dotnettrickscloud.blob.core.windows.net/img/designpatterns/composite.png)
```
The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the
same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of 
a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent 
part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat
individual objects and compositions uniformly
```

## Allows to combine different types of objects in tree structures
## Gives the possibility to treat the same object(s)
## Used when
### You have different objects that you want to treat the same way
### You want to present hierarchy of objects
