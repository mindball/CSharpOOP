```
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors 
to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
```

## When to use:
```
Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors 
to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
(observing the Open/Closed principle)
```
```
Use the pattern when it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s 
behavior using inheritance.
