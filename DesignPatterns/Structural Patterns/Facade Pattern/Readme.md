![Facade Pattern UML](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Example_of_Facade_design_pattern_in_UML.png)
## When to use:
```
The facade design pattern is particularly used when a system is very
complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large
number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable
```
### A simple interface is required to access to a complex system.
### The abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.
### Need an entry point to each level of layered software.
