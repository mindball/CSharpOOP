# Abstract Factory Design Pattern
```
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.
A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction
of a suite of "products".
The main purpose of the Abstract Factory Pattern is to isolate concrete classes created.
