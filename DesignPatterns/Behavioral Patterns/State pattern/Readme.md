# State pattern
```
State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its 
behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object 
changed its class.

## When to use
```
Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently 
depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, 
and the state-specific code changes frequently.
```
```
Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive 
conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to 
the current values of the classâ€™s fields.
```
```
Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar 
states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.
