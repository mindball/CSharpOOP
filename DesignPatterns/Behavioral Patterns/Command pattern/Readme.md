# Command pattern
```
the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object 
is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or 
trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method 
name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters
```
```
Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a 
stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
